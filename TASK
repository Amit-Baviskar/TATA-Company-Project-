# TASK 3 
 
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating 
customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain 
satisfied with their products. 


Solution-—Frist of all , data has to been clean for NULL customer numbers, by observing the chart we can seen the top 10 customer are contributing to revenue to a extent we can 
target this customer so there can repurchase the goods or we can provide offer to this customer at the lower revenue months for more revenue.

# TASK 4 
 
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. 
Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more 
business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no 
need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities. 

 
Solution-- As seen in map chart we can observe that , Europe has been the major customer of product of our company like Netherlands, Finland ,Sweden etc followed by Austrialia. 
But we can also Focus on North America had the product sold is less in this region . we have to form different plan for both regionfor more revenue opportunity
